# A simple quotes server

This server is created using the principles and data from another project (https://github.com/celso-henrique/naruto-quotes-server).
The original project used Python. I am using Node, Express, Nodemon and CSV parser.
It is a mock server!

It has only one route: GET
**localhost:7000/quotes**

It returns a random quote each time it is accessed.

=========================

**To execute**
- yarn
- yarn dev

**Important**
Feel free to use, it has study and/or mock purposes..
